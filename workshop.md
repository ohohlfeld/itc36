#Workshops

As part of the program, ITC 36 will feature additional workshops, with a PhD Workshop and the 7th Workshop on Network Calculus being confirmed so far. More information are summarized below.

## PhD Workshop

Description: Re-thinking fundamental networking functions, their modeling 
and their performance evaluation in the framework of the evolving Internet 
and cellular networks, in the era of cloud and content providers, is a 
target for the ITC community. The PhD workshop aims at fostering 
contributions and fresh ideas from young researchers, pursuing their PhD 
or having just completed their PhD. Discussion of their PhD ideas and 
progress, proposition of research challenges and directions is welcome 
during a dedicated workshop.

More information about the workshop can be found at the workshop webpage.


## 2025 International Workshop on Network Calculus

Description: Network calculus is a versatile methodology for the queueing analysis of resource-sharing systems. It can deal with problems that are fundamentally hard for alternative methodologies, using bounds rather than striving for exact solutions. The high modeling power of network calculus has been used in several important network engineering applications such as time sensitive networks, wireless sensor networks and Systems-on-Chip.
The goal of this workshop is to bring together researchers with an interest in the theory of network calculus as well as those who want to apply existing results in new applications. The workshop will serve to promote the network calculus theory to researchers with an interest in applied queueing models for data communication.
