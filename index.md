The INTERNATIONAL TELETRAFFIC CONGRESS {{ site.conference-name }}, to be held {{ site.conference-date }} at {{ site.conference-location-detail }}, is the {{ site.conference-number }} edition of this international flagship congress in the field of networking science and practice. ITC was founded back in 1955 by enthusiastic scientists and engineers who were willing to deploy networks in a holistic way. Since then, it has estab­lished a multi-decade tradition as the primary forum for presenting and dis­cussing the latest technical advances in the broad areas of teletraffic models, network systems, and measurements.

### Open Access and Digital Libraries

ITC follows an open access strategy. Accepted ITC conference and workshop papers can be downloaded from the open [ITC digital library](https://itc-conference.org/itc-library.html).
In addition, ITC makes the effort to index accepted papers in public A&I databases. By getting sponsorship of technical communities like IEEE and ACM, as well as sticking to corresponding rules with respect to technical quality, papers of previous ITC editions were included in the corresponding databases IEEE Xplore and ACM DL.

Since ITC retains the copyrights, it is possible to make the papers accessible for free via the ITC digital library. This helps to increase the visibility and accessibility of accepted papers.
