# Travel Grant

## Student Travel Grant Applications

The International Advisory Committee (IAC) of the ITC has decided to offer a number of travel grants (STG) that will be available to support full-time students for attending {{ site.conference-name }}. The amount of each grant is EUR 600 that can be used to cover student travel expenses related to attending {{ site.conference-name }} conference, such as student registration fee, airline ticket, and hotel accommodation expenses.

The **STG Application process** is open from **TODO DATE** until **TODO DATE**.
- The **application from the student** should state why he/she wants to attend {{ site.conference-name }} and how would he/she benefit from {{ site.conference-name }}. This description should be kept to a page maximum and uploaded through EDAS.
- The advisor of the student must also submit an **advisor's recommendation** stating that {{ site.conference-name }} covers the applicant's research areas, details whether the student is a PhD candidate, and outlines how the student outstands among other students. Upon application from the student, the advisor will receive an invitation from EDAS to submit the recommendation.

It is important that both the student and advisor clearly motivate the application with regards to the scientific scope of ITC and the research work of the applicant.

The Student Advisor must declare that additional expenses to attend the conference will be somehow covered, should a student be granted a STG.

If selected, the Student commits to send within two weeks after {{ site.conference-name }} a **two-page report** highlighting the benefits of having attended {{ site.conference-name }}, in terms of impact on his/her own research, of overall technical knowledge increase, and on technical exchanges and potential collaboration with other attendees.
