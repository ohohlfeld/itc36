# Travel Grants

# Broadening Participation in ITC 

The International Advisory Committee (IAC) of the ITC conference has decided to offer a number of travel grants that will be available to broaden participation in {{ site.conference-name }}. For that, travel grants are available to support full-time students and researchers who self-identify as marginalized and/or underrepresented in the community, and especially those who lack funding opportunities in their institutions. The amount of each TG is up to EUR 1000 that can be used to cover student travel expenses related to attending the conference, such as student registration fee, airline ticket, and hotel accommodation expenses. The exact value depends on geographical areas to maximize reach.

## Application Requirements

The application from the student should provide:

- A concise CV (possibly in European format)
- A letter stating why he/she wants to attend ITC 36 and how he/she would benefit from it. Students presenting at the PhD workshop should explicitly mention this in the letter.
- The letter should be kept to a maximum of one page.
- Contact information of the studentâ€™s advisor must also be reported.

The application, letter, and CV must be sent to:

- **Theo Benson**: [theophilus [at] cmu [dot] edu](mailto:theophilus@cmu.edu)
- **Jacek Rak**: [jrak [at] pg [dot] edu [dot] pl](mailto:jrak@pg.edu.pl)
