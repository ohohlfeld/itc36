# Call for Papers

The International Teletraffic Congress (ITC) in 2025 will take place at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Campus Trondheim, Norway. The 36th event of this series features the topic Sustainable Digital Infrastructures. It is sponsored by the Norwegian University of Science and Technology. During the event we will celebrate the 70th anniversary of the conference series, which took place in Copenhagen in 1955 for the first time.

The evolution of communications, networking and digital infrastructures is driving the digitalization of our society. The immense energy consumption of digital infrastructures and broader implications on the environment trigger the need to embed the sustainability paradigm into the technological development. Sustainable evolution of these technologies is triggered by the influence of computer science and telecommunication, the massive deployment of mobile communications and optics, the success of collaborative networking and social networks, the ever-increasing speed and flexibility of new communication technologies, networks, user devices, and applications, and the ever-changing operational challenges arising from these developments.

ITC 36 solicits original contributions that address the latest changes and developments in design, modelling, measurement, and performance evaluation of communication systems, networks, and services. The objectives in these areas include, among others, energy-efficiency and sustainable IT, network security and privacy, QoS and QoE, and resilience.
