title: Workshop on Network Calculus

# 2025 International Workshop on Network Calculus

“An exciting “new“ branch of queueing theory is emerging that deals with methods for finding approximation or bounding behavior for queues.”  – Leonard Kleinrock, 1976.

Network calculus is a branch of queueing theory, exploring the bounding behavior for queues. While network calculus was initially intended for performance guarantee analysis of queueing systems arising in Internet networks, it has been extended and applied to a much wider range of areas. They include various other types of communication networks such as wireless networks, sensor networks, IEEE 802.1 time-sensitive networking (TSN) networks, IETF Deterministic Networking (DetNet) networks, and wireless-powered communication systems. In addition, real-time systems(RTS), networks/systems on chip, computing systems, smart grid systems, energy storage systems and operations research have also found network calculus to be a useful tool. Furthermore, network calculus has contributed appealing results to the classical queueing theory.

The goal of this workshop is to bring together researchers with an interest in the theory of network calculus as well as those who want to apply existing results in new applications. The workshop will serve to promote the network calculus theory to researchers with an interest in applied queueing models for data communication. The workshop also aims to provide a platform for networking with experts in the field, providing attendees with the chance to discuss collaborative research and new initiatives.

The workshop is open for ITC attendees and registered workshop participants that are interested in network calculus. Registration information will be provided at a later stage.

## Call for Presentations

 The idea is to have an informal meeting with presentations of recent work in the context of network calculus (theory, applications, tool support) and gather as many network calculus experts as possible to discuss about the future development of the theory and its application opportunities. Hence, there are no written papers and everyone can present his/her "hottest" recent research on network calculus.

 If you would like to present you will need to submit:

   1. The title of your presentation.
   2. The abstract of your presentation.
   3. The name of the presenter.


Please send this information to Yuming Jiang, **yuming.jiang@ntnu.no** with email topic "Woneca Submission". Submission deadline is February 28th, 2025. The expected notification is end of March 2025.
