        <b>Title:</b> Revolutionizing Datacenter Networks with Optical Circuit Switches and Self-Adjusting Topologies<br />
        <b>Abstract:</b> With the growing popularity of cloud computing and data-intensive applications such as machine learning, datacenter networks have become a critical infrastructure for our digital society. Given the explosive growth of datacenter traffic and the slowdown of Moore’s law, significant efforts have been made to improve datacenter network performance over the last decade. A particularly innovative solution is reconfigurable datacenter networks (RDCNs): datacenter networks whose topologies dynamically change over time, in either a demand-oblivious or a demand-aware manner. Such dynamic topologies are enabled by recent optical switching technologies and stand in stark contrast to state-of-the-art datacenter network topologies, which are fixed and oblivious to the actual traffic demand. In particular, reconfigurable demand-aware and “self-adjusting” datacenter networks are motivated empirically by the significant spatial and temporal structures observed in datacenter communication traffic. In this talk, we present an overview of reconfigurable datacenter networks. In particular, we discuss the motivation for such reconfigurable architectures, review the technological enablers, and present a taxonomy that classifies the design space into two dimensions: static vs. dynamic and demand-oblivious vs. demand-aware. We discuss different architectures and protocols for such networks and point out research challenges.<br />

        <b>Speaker</b>: Ramesh K. Sitaraman<br />
        <b>Affiliation</b>: University of Massachusetts Amherst and Akamai Technologies<br />
        <b>Title</b>: Living on the Edge for a Quarter Century: A Personal Retrospective<br />
        <b>Abstract</b>: As Akamai and the creation of the “edge” turn 25, we look back at the key role that the edge has played in the evolution of internet services. The story of the edge started in the late 1990s when servers were deployed worldwide to provide content delivery services for web pages and videos. The quest to move dynamic content and application logic closer to users created the first edge computing services a few years later. The growth of the edge that now spans thousands of locations has dramatically increased the scope and importance of services that critically rely on it. This has created new challenges in operating the edge at scale and securing it from sophisticated attacks. Further, the growth of AI has precipitated novel services that host and serve ML models from the edge. Finally, as the carbon footprint of the edge grows rapidly, reimagining a sustainable “zero-carbon” edge powered by renewable energy poses a key direction for future research.
        <br />
        <b>Biography</b>: Ramesh K. Sitaraman is a Distinguished University Professor and Associate Dean in the College of Information and Computer Sciences at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. His research focuses on multiple facets of Internet-scale distributed systems, including algorithms, architectures, performance, and sustainability. He is best known for pioneering content delivery and edge computing services that currently deliver much of the world’s web content, streaming videos, and online applications. As a principal architect at Akamai, he helped create the world’s first major content delivery network (CDN) and later the first edge computing service. He retains a part-time role as Akamai’s Chief Consulting Scientist.
        Prof. Sitaraman is a Fellow of the ACM, IEEE, and AAAS. He is a recipient of the inaugural ACM SIGCOMM Networking Systems Award for his work on the Akamai CDN, the ACM IMC Test-of-Time award for his work on video quality, an Excellence in DASH award for his contribution to the MPEG-DASH reference video player standard, and the IEEE William R. Bennett Prize for his work on adaptive bitrate (ABR) algorithms for video streaming that are widely used in practice. He is a recipient of the Distinguished Teaching Award (DTA), the university’s highest recognition of teaching. He received a B. Tech from the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras, and a Ph.D. in computer science from Princeton University.<br />

        <b>Title</b>: A Slice through Four Decades: Connecting the Dots<br />
        <br />
        <b>Abstract</b>: Recently, I published a paper on the k-widest path problem with my collaborators. Interestingly, my interest in this problem piqued from teletraffic routing and design that I first worked on in the late 1980s. How do you connect the dots in your research? In this talk, I’ll slice through a few examples like this one to cover the trajectory of my research work spanning nearly four decades. <br />
        <br />
        <b>Biography</b>: Dr. Medhi retired as Curators' Distinguished Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering at the University of Missouri-Kansas City (UMKC), USA, which he joined in 1989. He was a rotating program director at NSF from August 2018 to August 2022 before he retired from UMKC. He's now designated as Curators' Distinguished Professor Emeritus by the Board of Curators of the University of Missouri System.  He started his permanent position as a Program Director at NSF in September 2022. He received B.Sc. in Mathematics from Cotton College, Gauhati University, India, M.Sc. in Mathematics from St. Stephen's College, University of Delhi, India, and his M.S. and Ph.D. in Computer Sciences from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, USA. Prior to joining UMKC in 1989, he was a member of the technical staff at AT&T Bell Laboratories from 1987 to 1989 where he was first introduced to teletraffic routing.  While at AT&T Bell Labs he co-developed Facility Diverse Routing - a feature that was deployed in AT&T's nationwide dynamic routing network. <br />
        <br />
        Dr. Medhi has made significant contributions to the field of computer networks, particularly in the areas of algorithms, routing, planning, reliability, and network management. He is the author of several seminal papers on optimization models for network design and their applications to multi-hour teletraffic, dynamic routing, and network survivability. Additionally, he has co-authored two widely recognized books on network design and routing. Deep Medhi has also actively served the scientific community by organizing multiple conferences and participating as a member of the editorial boards of prestigious journals. He has played an important role within the ITC community in various capacities. He has published eight papers and three poster papers in ITC congresses over two decades, delivered a keynote speech at ITC 19, served as General Co-chair of ITC 22, and was a member of the IAC from 2007 to 2015.<br />
